### Description

There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo` via the port `2220`. The password for the user `bandit28-git` is the same as for the user `bandit28`.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

### Walkthrough

First, let's create a temp directory:
```bash
bandit28@bandit:~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.NMFW1ssNBk
bandit28@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.NMFW1ssNBk
```
Now we clone the git repository:
```bash
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp.NMFW1ssNBk$ git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit28-git/repo
Cloning into 'repo'...
The authenticity of host '[localhost]:2220 ([127.0.0.1]:2220)' can't be established.

Looks like the password is hidden. Let's check the Git history:
```bash

Interesting, maybe if we could check the contents of the previous commits we could find the password.
So now we inspect the previous commit:
```bash
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp.NMFW1ssNBk/repo$ git show fb0df1358b1ff146f581651a84bae622353a71c0
