### Walkthrough

First let's create a temp directory
```bash
bandit27@bandit:~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.48jJwmTDaZ
bandit27@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.48jJwmTDaZ
```
Now we try to clone the git repository:
```bash
bandit27@bandit:/tmp/tmp.48jJwmTDaZ$ git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit27-git/repo
Cloning into 'repo'...
...
